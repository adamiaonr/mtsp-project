%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
The work presented in this paper explores the field of semi-supervised learning, 
applied to a particular problem: text classification. We explore 
a generative model for text classification --- Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) --- and from 
there we advance to a semi-supervised setting by combining it with the 
Expected Maximization (EM) algorithm, studying some techniques 
to augment it. We finally present results from our own and third-party 
implementations of such models, by using the well-known 20 Newsgroups dataset.
