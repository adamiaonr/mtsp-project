%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}

At the time of its inception, the Internet mostly served the purposes of 
communication between connected end-hosts. Now, at the World Wide Web 
era, the Internet is immersed in a content-centric paradigm, more 
concerned about content generation, sharing and access. Recently, 
a new research trend --- 
Information Centric Networking (ICN) --- started advocating for deep 
modifications on the Internet's network layer, making it content-centric by 
design, including the widespread use of in-network 
caching.\shortvertbreak

In this paper, we focus on the analysis of cache behavior in 
a specific ICN architecture --- Named 
Data Networking (NDN) --- under different cache algorithms, network 
topologies and content 
usage characteristics. To do so, we specify a simple and but modular NDN router 
model, loosely inspired in nonlinear dynamical 
systems. We implement the specified model in MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, providing 
some simulation results with three simple cache algorithms, specifically (1) Least Recently 
Used (LRU), (2) More Recently Used (MRU) and (3) Random caching.
