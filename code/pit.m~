    properties
        
        % the PIT is simply a C x I matrix which relates some content
        % entry c (in this case represented by the row, numbered from 1 to 
        % C) with a set of outgoint interfaces for Interest packets (i.e. 
        % the columns 1 to I, where I is equal to the number of interfaces
        % of the NDN router)
        PIT = []

            % this pair of operations may not be entirely correct, so
            % discard it for now and stick to a basic PIT operation
            %i = (obj.PIT(:,iface) < 0);
            %obj.PIT(i,iface) = obj.PIT(i,iface) + entry(i);

            % simply OR the entry Interest values to the corresponding
            % column on the PIT
            obj.PIT(i, iface) = obj.PIT(i, iface) + entry(i);
            
            % make sure it is encoded as 1 and 0 (avoid the values eq. to

        function [] = clearPITcontent(obj, content)

        end
        
        % updates the state of the PIT, according to the Interest inputs,
        % and returns the Interest indexes which should be forwarded
        % upstream

            % first, collect all the content indexes for which outstanding
            % Interests do not exist yet. these will be the Interests which
            % will be re-forwarded upstream.
            outputs = ~sum(obj.PIT, 2) & sum(inputs, 2);
            
            % second, given the inputs on all interfaces, OR it with the
            % PIT contents. One assumes that 'inputs' in a C x I matrix
            % containing all the Interest signals received on the input
            % ports of all the router's interfaces. In short, a '1' entry
            % on position (c,i) in the PIT means that an
            % Interest for content at row c has been received at interface 
            % i and awaiting a corresponding Data object.            
            obj.PIT = (obj.PIT | inputs);

        % on PIT processing (i.e. after discarding unsolicited Data
        % packets)
        function outputs = updateOnData(obj, inputs)
        
            % basically, discard all the row values for which there is no
            % outstanding PIT entry
            outputs = sum(obj.PIT, 2) & sum(inputs, 2);
            
            % now, free the positions in the PIT (since the awaiting Data
            % packets are about to be forwarded downstream)
            obj.PIT = (obj.PIT & ~inputs);
